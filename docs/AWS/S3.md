### Important from my learnings

- S3, if you are using as for datalake, we also need to manage the data lifecycle managment
- Historical data will increase the storage size and cost
- data version, if you are doing this, this will also increase data size and cost
- implement the data lifecycle policy
- cateful usage of the s4 tags on the objects
- if PII data, use encryption keys to encrypt the data at rest
